### (a) Summary of results
 

### (b) Explanation of observed dynamics given model assumptions


### (c) Model assumptions
- #### Number/type of immune classes considered

- #### _if available:_ Initial distribution of susceptibility

   - ##### Proportion of people that were infected with Omicron before March 13

   - ##### Proportion of people that are na√Øve at start of projection (not vaccinated or infected)

   - ##### Other

- #### Initial variant characteristics (including Omicron transmissibility, immune escape, and how uncertainty or non-identifiability was handled) 

- #### Process for setting/calibrating P(hosp given current infection) and P(death given current infection)

- #### Waning immunity details (e.g., distribution used)

- #### Seasonality implementation

- #### Emerging variant details (including introduction process)

- #### Nonpharmaceutical interventions
