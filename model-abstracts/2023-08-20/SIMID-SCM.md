### Waning of protection against infection
Waning is performed as a constant rate stochastic transfert from full protection compartments to waning compartments, with 6/log(2) mean, which corresponds to 6 month median.

### Vaccine effectiveness
Fixed inputs on vaccine effectiveness
Vaccine type | Alpha Infection | Alpha severe | Delta Infection | Delta severe | Omicron Infection* | Omicron severe
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
Adeno: 1st dose | 49% | 76% | 43% | 76% | 18%* | 65%
Adeno: 2nd dose | 74% | 86% | 83% | 95% | 49%* | 81%
mRNA: 1st dose | 48% | 83% | 72% | 79% | 32%* |65%
mRNA: 2nd dose | 94% | 95% | 91% | 99% | 66%* | 81%
Natural immunity | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100%
Waning  after 2 doses or natural immunity (opti) | 63% | 92% | 63% | 92% | 46%* | 81%
Waning  after 2 doses or natural immunity (pessi) | 63% | 92% | 63% | 92% | 26%* | 65%
Booster (1st/2nd/3rd) (mRNA) | 94% | 95%  | 95% | 99% | 67%* | 90%
Hybrid immunity | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100%
Waning after booster or hybrid immunity (opti) | 89% | 92% | 89% | 92% | 47%* | 90%
Waning after booster or hybrid immunity (pessi) | 89% | 92% | 89% | 92% | 27%* | 72%

*Omicron variants (regrouped as ba1/ba2, ba4/ba5, bq1/ba2.75/xbb, xbb1.5/xbb1.16/xbb1.9) have additional reductions in vaccine effectiveness and protection from previous infections (previous variants) which are estimated by the model (immune evasion concerning new infections). New bivariant boosters (mRNA) avoid those reductions vs current and previous variants (as well as protection from previous infections with the current variant).

Protection after waning vs alpha and delta variant are fixed by the literature. Protection after waning vs omicron-like variants are according to scenarios in comparison to the protection after 2 doses or a booster dose. Protection after waning from natural or hybrid immunity are similar to those after waning from 2 doses or booster doses in order to avoid long term differences in case of re-vaccination.

Waning is performed as a constant rate stochastic transfert (exponential process) from full protection compartments to waning compartments, with 6/log(2) months mean, which corresponds to 6 months median.
