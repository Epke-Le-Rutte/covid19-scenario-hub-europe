## Round 5 scenarios

### Waning of protection against infection
FILL

#### Optimistic waning of protection against infection 
FILL (if applicable)

#### Pessimistic waning of protection against infection
FILL (if applicable)

#### Any variation from the scenarios as specified
FILL (if applicable)

### Vaccination

#### Any variation from the scenarios as specified
We assume that Comirnaty XBB.1.5 is the only type of vaccination distributed during the vaccination campaign. This monovalent vaccine is assumed to provide the same protection against an infection with XBB.1.5. as the original mRNA vaccines protected against the wild-type of SARS-CoV-2. In the "pessimistic" and "optimistic" cases, we specified that agents could only get the new vaccinations if they hadn't been infected or vaccinated in the last year (as per STIKO reccomendation) and that only agents who were already vaccinated (+ potentially boostered) could recieve the booster. For the "upper-limit" case, we reduced the wait period to 6 months and also allowed unvaccinated agents to receive the booster. 


## Additional assumptions

### Age groups 
FILL 

### Vaccination
FILL

### Vaccine effectiveness


### Number/type of immune classes considered
FILL (if applicable)

#### Initial distribution of susceptibility 
In our model, whenever an agent recovers, they are automatically considered susceptible again. They never reach full immunity. Hence, every agent is (to a certain extent) susceptible.

##### Proportion of people that are na√Øve at start of projection (not vaccinated or infected)
FILL (if applicable)

#### Population ageing 
Not implemented

#### Assumptions on severity of infection of repeat infections
FILL

##### Other

FILL (if applicable)

### Seasonality implementation

Based on weather data, we set up the so-called "outdoor fraction", which determines the percentage of activities performed outside instead of inside.

### Contact rate and/or behaviour assumptions

#### Non-pharmaceutical interventions

None. 

#### Behaviour in response to case notification rates

Not implemented

### Other
