team_model_designation: primary
methods: Agent-based simulation model for COVID-19 based on a traffic simulation and mobile phone data
model_details:
  contact_tracing: Contact tracing with minimal capacity and 50% success rate.
  modeling_NPI: No NPIs are implemented.
  compliance_NPI: Not applicable.
  testing: No mandatory testing considered.
  vaccine_efficacy_transmission: Model vaccine efficacy is via our antibody model https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2023.107554, which is built upon http://DOI.org/10.1056/NEJMc2119236 and http://DOI.org/10.1056/NEJMc2201607.
  vaccine_efficacy_delay: Not applicable
  vaccine_hesitancy: No hesitancy integrated, but vaccination rates for round 5 are based on this round's guidelines.
  vaccine_immunity_duration: We assume an exponential decay rate (of antibody levels) whereas the decay rate depends on the scenario.
  natural_immunity_duration: Waning occurs with the same rate as for vaccine induced immunity.
  case_fatality_rate: Not applicable.
  infection_fatality_rate: Not applicable.
  asymptomatics: A rate of 0.2.
  age_groups: Agents can have any age between 0 and 99, but certain parameters and analyses employ different binning systems based on the available data.
  importations: Based on disease import for 2021 and 2022. Numbers were provided by the public health authorities in Cologne.
  confidence_interval_method: Not applicable
  calibration: Structural calibration against virus concentration in sewage data and shares of different VOCs.
  spatial_structure: Home and activity locations of agents are simulated using transportation model MATSim (http://matsim.org); in Episim these contact locations are simulated as containers with activity specific parameters.
