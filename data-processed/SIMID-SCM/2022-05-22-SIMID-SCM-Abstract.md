## (a) Modeller commentary

- #### Summary comments on results

Results concern scenario-based projections in Belgium.

Infections, and therefore hospital admissions and deaths, typically reach a long term equilibrium which is dependent on the assumed waning rate. This equilibrium is temporary disturbed each time a change in contacts/transmission is assumed.

- #### Comments on observed dynamics given model assumptions

The hypothesis on the waning rate has an important impact of the level of the equilibrium. Each time a change in contact behaviour/seasonality is assumed, there is a temporary divergence form the equilibrium during 2-4 months.

Under the Pessimistic fast immune waning assumption, a small new wave appear during summer due to the waning from the last omicron wave. Such summer wave is not present with the Optimistic slow immune waning.

Each scenario project a small temporary increase of transmission in September-October, which depends on the level reached during summer.

## (b) Model assumptions

### Round 1 scenarios

- #### Second booster campaign

Uptake based on Belgium data up to May 21 2022, then performing a campaign as in scenarios up to 50% of the uptake for 1st booster as on May 21 2022

   - ##### _if applicable:_ Any variation from the scenarios as specified

   - ##### Vaccine effectiveness assumptions
